# Count_Down
This game is based on the board game Count Down. The rules have been changed to fit a single player format on the Arduboy.

In this game you roll two dice and then Add, Subtract, Multiply, or Divide the dice to eliminate a number 1 though 10. If it has already been picked, or the number is invalid you get a strike. Three strikes and you lose.

Simple and a early project of mine. I have other project to follow.
